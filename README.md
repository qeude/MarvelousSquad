# MarvelousSquad

## 📖 Description

📱 Marvel Squad iOS app using Swift and [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/). App mainly done to explore and learn using UIKit coupled to Combine.

## 🛠 Setup

To get it work you should add a file named `Constants.swift` in the `Backend` package as bellow.

```swift
public struct Constants {
    public static let publicApiKey = "<YOUR_MARVEL_PUBLIC_API_KEY>"
    public static let privateApiKey = "<YOUR_MARVEL_PRIVATE_API_KEY>"
}
```

## 📦 Dependencies

I've tried to use as few external libraries as possible to learn about concepts.
